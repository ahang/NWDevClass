<!-- 1. Create a website (from scratch) that asks users if they eat steak.
2. If they respond with "yes", write the following to the page: “Here’s a Steak Sandwich!”
3. If they respond with "no", write the following to the page: “Here’s a Tofu Stir-Fry!”
Bonus: Ask what the user’s birth year is. If they are under 21, alert the following: “No Sake for you!”
Hint: You will need to use document.write() from a few slides back.
